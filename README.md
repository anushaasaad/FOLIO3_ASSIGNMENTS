# FOLIO3_ASSIGNMENTS
My name is Anusha and I am a junior year student at Fast National University. I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic student who is dedicated to gaining excellent experience in the field of Data Science and Web Development. Learn more about my field and improve my skills to better utilize my problem-solving abilities for organizational goals. 

In the following HTML/CSS work I have submitted one of my favorite designs that I designed and coded. 
My design was inspired by someone's website I saw on YouTube.
